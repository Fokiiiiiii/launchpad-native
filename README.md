# LaunchpadNative

A native, fully OSS macOS Launchpad replacement for macOS 26+ on Apple Silicon.
Runs as a resident `LSUIElement` utility (no Dock icon) and reproduces and
extends Classic Launchpad: paged/vertical app grid, folders, search, global
trigger gestures (hotkey, hot corner, F4, trackpad pinch), a window browser,
and a guided complete-uninstall tool for other apps.

No App Store distribution, no signing/notarization/DMG/installer, no paid
tiers — source only, built and run from this repository.

## Status

Early bootstrap (Phase 0 of the implementation plan). Only a minimal resident
host and the module/build scaffolding exist so far.

**Known limitation:** on a machine with only Xcode Command Line Tools (no
full Xcode.app), `swift build` works but `swift test` fails — neither the
`Testing` nor `XCTest` module resolves without Xcode.app selected as the
active developer directory (`xcode-select -p`). Install Xcode.app to run the
test suite; it will also be required later for Instruments-based performance
work (Phase 9).

## Requirements

- macOS 26+, Apple Silicon
- Swift 6 toolchain (Xcode Command Line Tools are sufficient; the full Xcode.app
  IDE is not required — this project builds via Swift Package Manager)

## Build & Run

This repo lives under `~/Documents`, which is iCloud-synced. SwiftPM's build
database gets disk I/O errors if `.build` sits inside a synced folder, so
always pass an out-of-iCloud `--scratch-path`:

```sh
SCRATCH=~/.cache/launchpad-native/build

swift build --scratch-path "$SCRATCH"       # build all targets
swift test --scratch-path "$SCRATCH"        # run unit tests
./Scripts/build-app.sh                       # assembles $SCRATCH/LaunchpadNative.app (LSUIElement)
open "$SCRATCH/LaunchpadNative.app"
```

## Architecture

See module boundaries and phase plan in `Sources/` as they land:
`AppHost`, `Diagnostics`, and (in later phases) `Catalog`, `Launcher`, `Grid`,
`Persistence`, `Triggers`, `PrivateAPI`, `WindowBrowser`, `Uninstall`,
`Settings`.

Private/undocumented system APIs (LaunchServices SPI, SkyLight,
MultitouchSupport, low-level HID key handling) are used where no public
equivalent exists, always behind a resolver that verifies symbols at runtime
rather than linking against guessed signatures. Where macOS 26 now ships a
public replacement (e.g. `NSGlassEffectView`, `SMAppService`,
`OSSystemExtensionRequest`, `NSWindow.CollectionBehavior`), the public API is
used instead.
